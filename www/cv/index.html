                        <p>
                        I'm Robert Heinicke, a software developer and architect from Leipzig. My
                        professional career consists of more than a decade of software development
                        work layered on a long interest in programming starting in my early teens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        My view on software architecture differs from the usual Architect role by
                        combining design work with implementation as part of the development team.
                        This helps me to incorporate feedback and implementation challenges into
                        future architeture designs. Thanks to this specific focus, I've been part of
                        many projects in their early phases, helping with both designing novel
                        solutions as well as implementing them.
                        </p>
                        <p>Since September 2016 I'm leading a team of software architects at XPURE. My
                        responsibilities include guiding technical discussions and training as well
                        as organizational tasks.

                            The original cloud platform design was done by me. It has since been
                            refined and matured together with a team of architects by Volkswagen.
